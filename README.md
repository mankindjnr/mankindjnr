<h2>About Me</h2>
I am <b>Amos Njoroge</b>, a backend engineer who just graduated from ALX. I am currently working on a project called <a href="https://aliasmpesa.onrender.com">MpesaAlias</a> which is a payment gateway that allows you to send and receive money from any mpesa number without having to share your original phone number.


 I am also working on a project called <a href="https://chama-zetu.onrender.com">chamaZetu</a> which is a chama management system that allows you to manage your chama activities online. It is still in its early stages.

 Outside the world of programming, I am a huge fan of Architecture, seeing the marvels of the world and how they were built is something that I really enjoy. I am also a Formula 1 fan and I support the RedBull #teamVerstappen.

 <h2>Achievements</h2>
Completing the ALX program is one of my greatest achievements. I have also been able to build a couple of projects that I am really proud of. I have also been able to learn a lot of new technologies and I am still learning more.

Graduating from the <b>KamiLImu</b> mentorship program.

leading <b>letsGoBig</b> savings group where in three years we have gone from saving ksh 400 a week to introducing REITs investments on top of our weekly savings.
